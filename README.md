## HeapInfo
While playing CTF with heap exploitation, we always need a debugger (e.g. gdb) for tracking memory layout. But we don't really need a debugger if we just want to see whether the heap layout same as our imagine or not. Hope this small tool helps us exploit easier ;).

Implement with ruby because I love ruby :P. But might also implement with Python (if no others did) in the future.

There's NOTHING here now. Will implement a pretty dump of heap / bin layout first, any suggestion of features is welcome.

Relation works are [pwntools-ruby](https://github.com/peter50216/pwntools-ruby) and [gdbpwn](https://github.com/scwuaptx/Pwngdb).
